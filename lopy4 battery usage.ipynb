    "## LoPy4 Battery Tests\n",
    "I wanted to test my LoPy4 battery usage under various usage sceanios. All tests were sending 2 Lorawan uploads (Location and sensor data) and then performing a deepsleep for a range of seconds (10,20,60,300,1200). The Scenarios were run until my power metter had seen at least 20mAh or current used and then the average current use per hour was recorded. The data and results are shown after this.\n",

    "### A: Pycom Expansion Board with LEDs\n",
    "In this setup I am running the lopy4 board on the pycom expansion board V3.1 see https://docs.pycom.io/datasheets/expansionboards/expansion3/ & https://github.com/wipy/wipy/blob/master/docs/User_manual_exp_board.pdf . This expansion board has a LED on it that glow all the time (i.e. the USD led) so will have some extra power draw even when the lopy4 is in deepsleep.\n",
